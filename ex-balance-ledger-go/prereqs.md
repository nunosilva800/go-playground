# Prerequisites (stuff you need to have installed to run this code)

To be able to run the code in the exercise, you will need to install some software onto your machine.  We've written the exercise code to have as few dependencies as possible to make the set up simple.

We recommend installing the required tools at least a day _before_ your scheduled interview, and setting aside at least an hour for it.

* A computer with a microphone and preferably a camera
* Go (at least 1.13)
  * Installation instructions for each operating system can be found in the [Go Installation guide](https://golang.org/doc/install)
* A text editor or IDE
  * There are no restrictions on which text editor to use
  * If you don't already have a text editor we recommend Visual Studio Code, which is free. You will also need to install [Google's Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go)

To verify your installation, try out the code in the [Getting Started tutorial](https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/getting-started) to build and run a "Hello World" example.
